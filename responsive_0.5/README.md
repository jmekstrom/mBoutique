# MBoutique Responsive 0.5

## Assignment:

Examine the Mboutique home page sections. Your goal will be to only build out the sections utilizing containing elements (divs or HTML5 elements are fine) and you may use borders or background colors to display the sections and verify your work.

1. Create a responsive design with a mobile breakpoint at 320px width.
2. The mobile design may eliminate the left image from the main content section upon hitting the breakpoint

Optional: Account for a tablet breakpoint (responsive/adaptive)

1. Create a responsive design with both mobile (320px) AND tablet (768px) breakpoints
2. How would you set up your flavors of the day to fit in nicely (refer to wireframe but do not have to match it)
